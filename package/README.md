# motion-solid

[SolidJS](https://solidjs.com) bindings for [Motion](https://motion.dev).

Please refer to the [docs](https://motion-solid.leanderriefel.com) for more information.

Please note that this library is still in early beta and the API is subject to change and may get daily breaking changes. The documentation may not be up to date with the latest features and may include missing or outdated information. You can always create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/leanderriefel/motion-solid) or, even better, open a pull request to fix the documentation or add new features.

## Maintenance status

`motion-solid` is currently only half-maintained. I currently have a lot of stress with university and private stuff, so updates will be very slow and there will likely be long periods without updates.

I will still respond to issues and pull requests. The library should generally work fine, but there will still be issues around exit animations, TypeScript types, and layout animations being slightly off.

If you want to seriously maintain this and help make it fully fledged, please open an issue or DM me on X: [@leanderriefel](https://x.com/leanderriefel).
