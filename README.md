# motion-solid

This is the repo for the `motion-solid` npm package (still in very early beta).

## Maintenance status

`motion-solid` is currently only half-maintained. I currently have a lot of stress with university and private stuff, so updates will be very slow and there will likely be long periods without updates.

I will still respond to issues and pull requests. The library should generally work fine, but there will still be issues around exit animations, TypeScript types, and layout animations being slightly off.

If you want to seriously maintain this and help make it fully fledged, please open an issue or DM me on X: [@leanderriefel](https://x.com/leanderriefel).
