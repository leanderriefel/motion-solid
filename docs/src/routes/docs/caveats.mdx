## Differences to motion/react and motion-vue

There are a few Solid-specific differences that can affect behavior:

1. Exit animations: In React and Vue, the library can keep component instances alive to play exit animations. In Solid, there are no runtime component instances. When `<Show>` or `<For>` remove items, `motion-solid` performs a DOM handoff and keeps the DOM element around instead. Exiting elements are no longer reactive.
2. Layout animations: Solid signals update the DOM synchronously, so there is no render cycle to hook into. `motion-solid` tracks common props like `class`, `style`, and text content. For other changes, use `layoutDependencies` to trigger layout measurements.
3. Animation controls: `animate={controls}` (AnimationControls) is not supported. Use targets or variants instead.
4. Custom components: `motion(Component)` is not supported yet (planned).
